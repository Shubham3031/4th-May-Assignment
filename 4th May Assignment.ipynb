    "\n",
    "Trend: A trend refers to a long-term systematic increase or decrease in the data over time. \n",
    "It indicates the overall direction or tendency of the series. Trends can be upward (rising), \n",

    "Seasonality: Seasonality refers to a pattern that repeats at regular intervals within a time series, \n",

    "such as monthly, quarterly, or yearly cycles. Techniques like seasonal decomposition or autocorrelation \n",

    "Cyclical: Cyclical patterns are similar to trends but occur over a longer time frame. \n",

    "Complex Patterns: Time series data can exhibit complex patterns that are challenging to capture accurately.\n",
    "The presence of multiple overlapping patterns, irregularities, or sudden changes in behavior can make \n",
    "forecasting difficult. Advanced modeling techniques and expertise may be required to capture and interpret \n",
    "these patterns effectively.\n",
